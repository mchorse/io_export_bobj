This is source code of BOBJ exporter add-on. BOBJ is an extension of OBJ format that provides also vertex weights, armature information and bone animations (in form of keyframes). It's used by [S&B Minecraft mod](https://github.com/mchorse/snb).

This add-on is based (i.e. modified to suit my format needs) on the bundled `io_scene_obj` Blender add-on (written by Campbell Barton and Bastien Montagne) which is under GPL license. To comply with GPL, the list of changes from the original source code is listed in `CHANGES.md` file.
