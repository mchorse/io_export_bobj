This is source code of BOBJ exporter add-on for **Blender 2.7.\***. **BOBJ** is an extension of OBJ format that provides also vertex weights, armature information and bone animations (in form of keyframes). It's used by [S&B Minecraft mod](https://github.com/mchorse/snb).

This add-on is based (i.e. modified to suit my format needs) on the bundled `io_scene_obj` Blender add-on (written by Campbell Barton and Bastien Montagne) which is under **GPL license** (see Python source code for license header). To comply with GPL license, the list of changes from the original source code is available in `CHANGES.md`.
